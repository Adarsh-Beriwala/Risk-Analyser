# Testing Guide for Enhanced Risk Assessment Page

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Start the Development Server
```cmd
cd "f:\Final Deployment\Team-A"
npm start
```

The server should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Navigate to Risk Assessment
Once the server is running, go to:
`http://localhost:3000/risk-assessment`

## What to Test

### ✅ Basic Functionality
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All four tabs are visible (Overview, Detailed Analysis, Risk Findings, Trends & Activity)
- [ ] Tab switching works smoothly
- [ ] Loading states appear when data is being fetched

### ✅ Overview Tab
- [ ] Metrics dashboard displays 6 key metrics
- [ ] Risk distribution pie chart renders
- [ ] SDE categories chart shows data
- [ ] "Run Assessment" button is functional

### ✅ Detailed Analysis Tab
- [ ] Detection methods bar chart displays
- [ ] Confidence distribution chart renders
- [ ] Data adapts to filter selections

### ✅ Risk Findings Tab
- [ ] Table loads with risk findings data
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Filters can be applied (Data Source, Risk Level, Sensitivity)
- [ ] Export to CSV button functions
- [ ] Row expansion shows detailed information

### ✅ Trends & Activity Tab
- [ ] Risk trend line chart displays
- [ ] Scan activity bar chart renders
- [ ] Time range selector functions

### ✅ Responsive Design
- [ ] Dashboard works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Charts resize appropriately
- [ ] Mobile navigation functions properly

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling when API is unavailable
- [ ] "No data available" messages display properly
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display errors

## Expected Behavior

### On First Load:
1. The page should display loading spinners
2. API calls are made to fetch dashboard data
3. Charts populate with actual data from your database
4. If no data exists, appropriate "no data" messages should appear

### Interactive Features:
1. **Filters**: Should update charts and tables dynamically
2. **Search**: Should filter the findings table in real-time
3. **Export**: Should download a CSV file with current filtered data
4. **Run Assessment**: Should trigger a new scan (if API is properly connected)

### Performance:
1. Charts should render smoothly without lag
2. Tab switching should be instant
3. Filtering should respond within 1-2 seconds

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Page shows "No data available" everywhere
**Solution**: 
- Check if your API endpoints are running
- Verify the `client_id` is properly set in `apiConfig.js`
- Ensure database has risk assessment data

### Issue: Charts not rendering
**Solution**:
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Verify Chart.js is loaded properly

### Issue: API errors in console
**Solution**:
- Check if the API server is running at the configured URL
- Verify CORS settings allow requests from localhost:3000
- Check network connectivity

### Issue: Styling looks broken
**Solution**:
- Verify all CSS files are loading
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
- Check for CSS conflicts in developer tools

## Console Commands for Testing

Open browser developer tools (F12) and try these commands:

```javascript
// Check if Chart.js is loaded
console.log(window.Chart);

// Check current route
console.log(window.location.pathname);

// Test API connectivity
fetch('https://report-risk-gen-1071432896229.asia-south2.run.app/risk/comprehensive-dashboard/your-client-id')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('API Response:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('API Error:', error));
```

## Success Criteria

The risk assessment page is working correctly when:

1. ✅ All tabs load without errors
2. ✅ Charts display actual data (not just loading states)
3. ✅ Interactive features (search, filters, export) function properly
4. ✅ Page is responsive on different screen sizes
5. ✅ Error handling works gracefully when data is unavailable
6. ✅ Performance is smooth with no lag or freezing

## Next Steps After Testing

If everything works correctly:
1. Consider removing the old risk assessment files
2. Update documentation for your team
3. Deploy to production environment

If issues are found:
1. Note specific error messages
2. Check browser console for details
3. Test individual components if needed
4. Make necessary adjustments to API integration

**Note**: This new risk assessment page completely replaces the old broken implementation and should provide a much better user experience with working charts and improved functionality.
