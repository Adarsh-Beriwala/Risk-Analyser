- [cite_start]Scanning is performed using pattern-based and context-aware detection, ensuring accurate identification of sensitive information[cite: 82, 121].

- [cite_start]All data access is logged and monitored for compliance[cite: 85, 124].
- [cite_start]The system supports encryption, masking, and tokenization to protect high-risk data[cite: 86, 125].
