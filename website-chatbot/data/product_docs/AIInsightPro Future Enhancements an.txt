AI-Insight-Pro Future Enhancements and Roadmap
Our Vision for Continuous Improvement
AI-Insight-Pro is constantly evolving to provide more advanced features, deeper insights, and enhanced automation for data privacy and risk management. Our roadmap is driven by industry needs and emerging security challenges.

Planned Features
1. Agent Orchestration with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
Concept: Implementing a robust workflow management system using DAGs (similar to Prefect or Apache Airflow).
Benefits:
- Automated Pipeline Scheduling: Automate complex data scanning and analysis pipelines.
- Improved Reliability: Enhanced error handling, retry logic, and dependency management for scans.
- Scalability: Better management of large-scale, distributed processing tasks.
- Visibility: Clear visualization of workflow progress and bottlenecks.

2. Enhanced Compliance Policy Mapping
Concept: Deepening the automation for mapping scan findings directly to specific clauses and requirements of various regulatory frameworks.
Benefits:
- GDPR Compliance Automation: More granular reporting and actionable steps for GDPR adherence.
- CCPA Compliance Features: Automated identification of data relevant to CCPA consumer rights.
- HIPAA Compliance Support: Advanced features for managing PHI and demonstrating HIPAA compliance.
- Expanded Frameworks: Future support for other global and industry-specific regulations.

3. SOC2 Report Generator
Concept: Automating the generation of SOC2 (Service Organization Control 2) reports.
Benefits:
- Auto-filled Reports: Pre-populating sections of SOC2 reports with data from AI-Insight-Pro's findings.
- Compliance Evidence Collection: Streamlining the gathering of evidence for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
- Audit Trail Generation: Providing comprehensive audit trails to support SOC2 audits.

4. RBAC for Advanced User Access Control
Concept: Implementing a more granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
Benefits:
- Fine-grained Permissions: Define highly specific permissions for users and groups.
- Multi-Tenant Support: Enhanced capabilities for managing multiple organizations or departments within a single instance.
- Improved Security: Minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data.

5. Threat Intelligence Feed Mapping
Concept: Integrating external threat intelligence feeds to enrich risk assessments.
Benefits:
- Real-time Threat Awareness: Incorporating the latest threat data into risk calculations.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual data access patterns or sensitive data movements that might indicate a threat.
- Proactive Security Alerting: Generating alerts based on a combination of SDE exposure and known threat indicators.

6. Automated Remediation Suggestions
Concept: Providing AI-driven suggestions for remediating identified risks, such as data masking, encryption, or access policy changes.

7. Integration APIs for Third-Party Systems
Concept: Developing robust APIs to allow seamless integration with other security tools, SIEM systems, and data governance platforms.

8. Mobile Application
Concept: Developing native iOS and Android applications for on-the-go monitoring and alerts.

9. Real-time Alerts
Concept: Implementing instant notifications for critical SDE detections or significant shifts in risk posture.
