AI-Insight-Pro: Consolidated Data Documentation
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-Insight-Pro platform, its features, and its functionalities. It is intended to be a central repository of information for the website's chatbot.

1. Introduction to AI-Insight-Pro
AI-Insight-Pro is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to help businesses identify, assess, and secure sensitive data across their enterprise. The platform acts as a privacy-aware AI system that performs automated data discovery, sensitive data element (SDE) detection, risk assessment, and compliance monitoring. The platform boasts impressive statistics, including over 500 enterprise clients, 99.9% data protection, 24/7 monitoring, and ISO 27001 certification.

2. Core Features
The AI-Insight-Pro platform is built with a robust set of features to handle various aspects of data privacy and security:

Automated Data Discovery: The system can scan and identify data from connected sources like PostgreSQL, BigQuery, GCS, and MySQL. The "Discover" page allows users to review discovered data sources and select objects for security scanning, such as a hospital_data(1).csv file within a GCP Bucket.

Sensitive Data Element (SDE) Detection: The platform detects sensitive data elements like PII, financial data, and healthcare data. The SDE Catalogue allows users to select SDEs based on their industry, such as "Restaurants," and view a list of available SDEs like id, name, and email. The dashboard shows that 23 Sensitive Data Elements (SDEs) have been detected.

Risk Scoring and Confidence Calculation: AI-Insight-Pro calculates risk scores and confidence levels for identified vulnerabilities. The risk assessment dashboard displays the number of medium, low, and high-risk SDEs, the total number of scans, the overall risk score, and a confidence percentage.

LLM-Generated Summaries and Business-Ready Reports: The platform can generate insightful summaries and reports. Reports can be generated in PDF, HTML, and LaTeX formats.

Compliance Monitoring: The platform aligns with major compliance frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, and the DPDP Act. The platform shows a compliance score, such as 62.5% for the DPDP regulation, and lists missing required SDEs like full_name, ssn, and phone_number. The compliance status can be "PARTIALLY COMPLIANT".

User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is built with React for easy user interaction. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the data security landscape.

CLI and API Access: The platform offers a command-line interface and API for programmatic access.

Custom Model Registry: Users can manage and register custom AI models for SDE detection. The Model Inventory page allows users to view and add models. The "Add Model" feature allows users to register a new model by providing details such as the model name, provider, industry use case, data store types (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, AWS S3), compliance requirements, and a weights location.

Ask About Your Data: A feature that allows users to ask questions about their data, such as "How many risk findings does my data have?" or "How many types of data do I have?".

3. How it Works: The Workflow
The AI-Insight-Pro workflow is structured into distinct frontend and backend processes.
